## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

During the making of this component I've spent a lot of time figuring
out how to structure it precisely without losing one half. I also
made use of a wrapper to ensure that the space outside the text part
was correct.

With some research I managed to size the picture in the right format
for both desktop and mobile. Flex was definitely helpful to ensure
that the items would stack once reaching a certain point for mobile.
